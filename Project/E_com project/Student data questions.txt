Part A â€“ Data Cleaning (Basic Handling)

Standardize the Gender column â†’ convert all values to "Male" or "Female".

Handle missing values:

Fill missing subject marks with the mean of that subject.

Replace missing City with "Unknown".

Check for duplicate records (if any) and remove them.

Create a new column TotalMarks = AIML + OS + DataScience.

Create a new column Result where "Pass" if student scored â‰¥ 40 in each subject, else "Fail".

Part B â€“ GroupBy & Aggregation (Core Concepts)

Find the average marks in each subject for Section A and Section B.

Find the highest scorer in AIML for each Section.

Calculate the average attendance percentage by City.

Find the top 5 students with the highest TotalMarks.

Calculate minimum, maximum, and average marks in each subject by Gender.

Part C â€“ Intermediate Analysis

Find the failure rate (percentage of failed students) in each Section.

Identify the student(s) with 100% attendance.

For each City, find the number of students who scored above 80 in AIML.

Calculate the average TotalMarks per City and sort cities in descending order.

Identify students who scored above average in all three subjects.

Part D â€“ Advanced Concepts

Add a new column Grade based on TotalMarks:

â‰¥ 240 â†’ "A",

180â€“239 â†’ "B",

120â€“179 â†’ "C",

< 120 â†’ "D".
ðŸ‘‰ Count how many students fall in each grade.

Compare average performance of Section A vs Section B in each subject.

Find the correlation between Attendance(%) and TotalMarks.

Identify students who are topper in at least one subject (AIML, OS, or DataScience).

Find the city-wise distribution of grades (pivot-style: City vs Grade counts).
