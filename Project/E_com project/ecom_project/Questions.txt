Part A – Data Cleaning

Some values in PaymentMode are inconsistent ("Cash", "CASH", "card", "Credit Card", "upi", "UPI").

Clean this column to standardize categories into "Cash", "Card", "UPI", "Online".

There are missing values in CustomerName, City, and Discount.
Show how you would:

Fill missing Discount with 0.

Replace missing City with "Unknown".

Drop rows where CustomerName is missing.

Part B – GroupBy & Aggregation

Find the total sales value (Quantity × Price after discount) for each City.

For each Category, calculate:

Total Quantity Sold

Average Price of Products

Maximum Discount Applied

Identify the top 3 customers (by name) who spent the most overall.

Find the most popular product (highest Quantity sold) in each City.

Part C – Advanced Analysis

Add a new column Revenue = Quantity × Price × (1 - Discount/100).
Now, calculate monthly total revenue and plot the trend.

Compare average revenue per order between Cash, UPI, and Card.
Which payment mode is most profitable?

Find category-wise revenue share per city (i.e., percentage of total revenue by category within each city).

Identify customers who bought from at least 3 different categories.
